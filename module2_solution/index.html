<h1>Menu of Meals</h1>
<div id="div1"><p id="p1">Soups</p>
    For decades, grandmas have recommended chicken soup for flu or an easy pumpkin soup for diarrhea. 
    Why? That’s because soups are often chock full of nutrient-dense vegetables and meats that are slow 
    cooked so that these ingredients retain their nutritious value, delivering a meal in a bowl that is 
    easy.</div>
<div id="div2"><p id="p2">Drinks</p>Soft drinks are one of the significant beverage products in this 
    postindustrial era and have become a fast growing sales item in the last few decades. Soft drinks 
    can be classified into several groups based on its sugar contents, carbonation level, 
    ingredients, and functionality.</div>
<div id="div3"><p id="p3">Tea</p>We believe that trustworthy health information should be free
    to everyone and we rely on advertising to make that possible. Providing authoritative experiences 
    that are reviewed by physicians and other health and wellness professionals is expensive, but it’s an
    invaluable service.</div>
